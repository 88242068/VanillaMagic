General ideas not yet started to be implemented:
    
1 - New Quarry Upgrade
    Module which will automatically place new IInventory from Input
    Optional sorting digged items
    If current output is destroyed, go back to original output position
    
2 - Bridge between 2 IInventorys
    One Inventory -> Input
    Second Inventory -> Output
    Transfer items from Input to Output
    TileEntityInventoryBridge -> holds information about second TEIB
